\usage{
ResampleEMtree(counts, vec_covar = NULL, covariate = NULL, O = NULL,
  v = 0.8, S = 100, maxIter = 30, cond.tol = 1e-14, cores = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{Data of observed counts with dimensions n x p, either a matrix, data.frame or tibble.}

\item{vec_covar}{Vecteur of quoted covariates to be accounted for with dimension n x d, with the data.frame of covariates. For example with
X matrix of covariates : c("X$first", "X$second").}

\item{covariate}{if a covariate matrix is already ready to be given to the lm function, it can be used here.}

\item{O}{Matrix of offsets, with dimension n x p}

\item{v}{The proportion of observed data to be taken in each sub-sample. It is the ratio (sub-sample size)/n}

\item{S}{Total number of wanted sub-samples.}

\item{maxIter}{Maximum number of EMtree iterations at each sub-sampling.}

\item{cond.tol}{Tolerance for the psi matrix.}

\item{cores}{Number of cores, can be greater than 1 if data involves less than about 32 species.}
}
\value{
Returns a list which contains the Pmat data.frame, and vectors of EMtree maximum iterations and running times in each
resampling.
\itemize{
 \item{Pmat: }{S x p(p-1)/2 matrix with edge probabilities for each resample}
 \item{maxIter: }{EMtree maximum iterations in each resampling.}
 \item{times: }{EMtree running times in each resampling.}
}
